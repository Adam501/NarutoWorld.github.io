##### What Abilities Are
Abilities represent the fruits of your character's training, and the ways in which they've developed as a shinobi. What abilities you take will play a large role in shaping how you perform in combat and other situations.

Abilities are more specific than skills; they differ from jutsu in that while a jutsu is a specific technique, any ability is a way of doing something or a permanent increase in your capabilities.

Most abilities are passive improvements, giving you new capabilities or making you able to do a certain thing better.

You may choose to 'not use' a given ability at any time, essentially a form of holding back.

##### Purchasing Abilities
Abilities are acquired by spending XP. Some abilities will list only a "Base Cost"; for those abilities, you spend that much XP and acquire the ability, and that is it.

Others will list both a "Base Cost" and a "Scale." These abilities can be purchased more than once. The first time, you pay the Base Cost in XP; each future purchase has its cost increased by the Scale.

For example, the Enhanced Hearing ability has Base Cost 4, Scale 3. One rank of Enhanced Hearing would cost 4 XP. The second would cost (4+3) 7 XP, and the third would cost (4+3+3) 10 XP. So, the total XP spent to get all three ranks would be (4 + 7 + 10) 21 XP.

Abilities with more than one rank will also include a Limit entry. This is what controls how many ranks of the ability you can have. So, if an ability (such as Attentive) said "Research /5" and you had 12 ranks of Research, you could buy that ability twice.

Many abilities will include in their limit line a maximum, such as "Limit: CHA /10, max 4". This means that you may take that ability up to that many times (so in that example, 4).

Certain abilities will also say "Requires: (something)". You cannot take any ranks in that ability unless you meet the requirement.

## Chakra

##### Nature Control

#### -=[ Elemental Affinity ]=-
Every ninja has a natural affinity for one of the five primary elements, though some may not discover it until later. This ability can be taken for any one of the five elements, even one your character cannot use. For each rank, you get a +1 bonus to Chakra Exhaustion and Chakra Control rolls involving your favored element. The Chakra Control skill requirements to learn jutsu according to rank are considered 1 point lower, per rank, for your chosen element. Some clans start with a specific Elemental Affinity, giving them one rank in this ability. This does not (necessarily) provide them with the matching Elemental Aptitude, though it does mean they cannot change their affinity.

- Base Cost: 0
- Scale: +1
- Limit: CHA /20, max 5
- Special: You may only take this ability for a single element, ever.

#### -=[ Elemental Aptitude ]=-
The shinobi of the world recognize five primary elements of chakra: fire, water, wind, earth, and lightning. These elements and their properties form the basis of most modern ninjutsu techniques. However, actually using elemental chakra requires the ability to convert one's own chakra to the appropriate element, which is what this ability provides. In simpler terms, when you take Elemental Aptitude, select one of the five elements; you may use elemental ninjutsu of that element. Each additional rank of this ability allows you to use another element. Certain clans begin with one or more ranks in this ability. In these cases, they have the first one or two ranks in this ability for free, but must pay that cost when buying the next one. For example, a Touu begins with elemental aptitude for Water and Wind. Normally, this would cost (5 + (5+25)) 35 XP; instead, it costs 0. However, when they buy access to their third element, doing so costs (55 + 35) 90 XP.

- Base Cost: 5
- Scale: +25
- Limit: 3

##### Shape Control

#### -=[ Homing ]=-
-=[ Homing ]=-
With precise chakra control, you can learn to curve and aim your ninjutsu in such a way to ensure they hit more effectively. You may give your ninjutsu a bonus of +1 Accuracy per rank, by increasing the Chakra and/or Stamina cost(s) of the ninjutsu by 2 per +1 added. Ninjutsu with a range of Touch, and those which have an Area (e.g., are Area of Effect), can not have this ability applied to them.

- Base Cost: 8
- Scale: 4
- Limit: Chakra Control ranks/5, max 6

#### -=[ Improved Area ]=-
This supplements your ninjutsu techniques, increasing their areas of effect by up to your ninjutsu damage bonus; you can use some, all, or none of this effect on a given technique, as you please. This bonus cannot exceed the technique's base area. This bonus only applies to ninjutsu that deal damage.

- Base Cost: 20

#### -=[ Improved Range ]=-
You're able to keep your chakra coherent for longer; the further it can travel before dissipating (or the faster you can propel it, or whatever)... well, the advantages should be obvious. This increases the range of any ninjutsu technique you use by up to double your ninjutsu damage bonus in yards. This bonus cannot exceed the technique's base range.

- Base Cost: 20

#### -=[ Potent Chakra ]=-
You're able to increase your chakra's density, and in turn preserve some of the energy that would dissipate into the atmosphere around you in whatever sort of attack you're using.
But all you really care about is that it makes your ninjutsu hurt more! Each rank increases your ninjutsu damage bonus by 0.2.

- Base Cost: 1
- Scale: 1
- Limit: CHA /10
- Requires: 80 CHA

##### Chakra Control
#### -=[ Refined Chakra Control ]=-
Your precise control of chakra allows you to spend it more efficiently, wasting less and getting more out of what you do spend. Each rank of this ability gives you a +1 bonus on your Chakra Exhaustion rolls.

- Base Cost: 6
- Scale: 2
- Limit: Chakra Control /5

#### -=[ Wall Walking ]=-
Every village teaches this, usually to their genin, as a form of training to hone their chakra control skills. Training involves focusing a fixed amount of chakra at the bottom of one's feet and using that to adhere to a wall, tree, or other vertical surface. With this ability you can scale vertical surfaces, stand on ceilings, and so forth, at your normal movement speed.

- Base Cost: 10
- Requires: 8 Chakra Control

#### -=[ Water Walking ]=-
You can stand on water! Ninja do this in the same way they'd adhere to a vertical surface, though actually pulling it off is much harder because the water is constantly moving underneath them, meaning the strength and distribution of chakra has to be constantly changed. Once a shinobi is skilled enough, though, this becomes second nature, just like keeping one's balance on an unsteady surface.

- Base Cost: 15
- Requires: 15 Chakra Control, Wall Walking

##### 4. Genjutsu
#### -=[ Genjutsu Awareness ]=-
You're good at picking up little details in your environment that aren't quite what they should be. Maybe it's that the ringing noise in your head isn't reverberating right, maybe it's that whoever constructed an illusion around you forgot to put door handles on all the doors. You get a +1 bonus to defensive Genjutsu rolls per rank.

- Base Cost: 10
- Scale: 5
- Limit: Lower of your Enhanced Hearing or Enhanced Sight ranks

#### -=[ Genjutsu Competence ]=-
Genjutsu is notoriously difficult; very few ninja are able to just 'pick it up' without difficulty. Even being mediocre with genjutsu requires a significant amount of training and practice--which this ability represents. Each rank gives you a +1 bonus to your offensive Genjutsu rolls.

- Base Cost: 2
- Scale: 0
- Limit: (XP + 200)/400

#### -=[ Genjutsu Mastery ]=-
Okay, NOW you've mastered the art of Genjutsu. Each rank gives you a +1 bonus to genjutsu rolls. You can have 1 rank in this ability for each rank of genjutsu you know at least one technique from. Thus, if you knew an E-rank, D-rank, and B-rank move, you could have 3 ranks of Genjutsu Mastery.

- Base Cost: 6
- Scale: 4
- Limit: Special

#### -=[ Genjutsu Training ]=-
You've mastered the art of... yeah, okay, no. You are able to use entry-level Genjutsu techniques. It's not much, but it's a start.

- Base Cost: 20
- Requires: Research 4

#### -=[ Illusion Multi-Targeting ]=-
This allows you to apply a genjutsu which normally must target a single person at once to any number of people. Every 1 point of Willpower spent allows your genjutsu to target two more people, at no additional cost and using your same genjutsu roll.

- Base Cost: 25
- Requires: Know at least one C-rank Genjutsu

#### -=[ Mettle ]=-
Shinobi training includes not only dodging and withstanding blows to the body, but to the mind as well. With this, you're more adept at discerning the usage and resisting the effects of most subtle of shinobi methods, which is handy to keep yourself from becoming caught unaware by the other, more deadly tactics ninja employ, as well as enabling you to use those same subtleties against others. Each rank gives a +1 bonus to your Genjutsu rolls.

- Base Cost: 8
- Scale: 3
- Limit: Resistance /5
