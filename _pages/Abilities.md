##### What Abilities Are
Abilities represent the fruits of your character's training, and the ways in which they've developed as a shinobi. What abilities you take will play a large role in shaping how you perform in combat and other situations.

Abilities are more specific than skills; they differ from jutsu in that while a jutsu is a specific technique, any ability is a way of doing something or a permanent increase in your capabilities.

Most abilities are passive improvements, giving you new capabilities or making you able to do a certain thing better.

You may choose to 'not use' a given ability at any time, essentially a form of holding back.

##### Purchasing Abilities
Abilities are acquired by spending XP. Some abilities will list only a "Base Cost"; for those abilities, you spend that much XP and acquire the ability, and that is it.

Others will list both a "Base Cost" and a "Scale." These abilities can be purchased more than once. The first time, you pay the Base Cost in XP; each future purchase has its cost increased by the Scale.

For example, the Enhanced Hearing ability has Base Cost 4, Scale 3. One rank of Enhanced Hearing would cost 4 XP. The second would cost (4+3) 7 XP, and the third would cost (4+3+3) 10 XP. So, the total XP spent to get all three ranks would be (4 + 7 + 10) 21 XP.

Abilities with more than one rank will also include a Limit entry. This is what controls how many ranks of the ability you can have. So, if an ability (such as Attentive) said "Research /5" and you had 12 ranks of Research, you could buy that ability twice.

Many abilities will include in their limit line a maximum, such as "Limit: CHA /10, max 4". This means that you may take that ability up to that many times (so in that example, 4).

Certain abilities will also say "Requires: (something)". You cannot take any ranks in that ability unless you meet the requirement.

## Chakra

##### 1. Nature Control
#### -=[ Elemental Affinity ]=-
Every ninja has a natural affinity for one of the five primary elements, though some may not discover it until later. This ability can be taken for any one of the five elements, even one your character cannot use. For each rank, you get a +1 bonus to Chakra Exhaustion and Chakra Control rolls involving your favored element. The Chakra Control skill requirements to learn jutsu according to rank are considered 1 point lower, per rank, for your chosen element. Some clans start with a specific Elemental Affinity, giving them one rank in this ability. This does not (necessarily) provide them with the matching Elemental Aptitude, though it does mean they cannot change their affinity.

- Base Cost: 0
- Scale: +1
- Limit: CHA /20, max 5
- Special: You may only take this ability for a single element, ever.

#### -=[ Elemental Aptitude ]=-
The shinobi of the world recognize five primary elements of chakra: fire, water, wind, earth, and lightning. These elements and their properties form the basis of most modern ninjutsu techniques. However, actually using elemental chakra requires the ability to convert one's own chakra to the appropriate element, which is what this ability provides. In simpler terms, when you take Elemental Aptitude, select one of the five elements; you may use elemental ninjutsu of that element. Each additional rank of this ability allows you to use another element. Certain clans begin with one or more ranks in this ability. In these cases, they have the first one or two ranks in this ability for free, but must pay that cost when buying the next one. For example, a Touu begins with elemental aptitude for Water and Wind. Normally, this would cost (5 + (5+25)) 35 XP; instead, it costs 0. However, when they buy access to their third element, doing so costs (55 + 35) 90 XP.

- Base Cost: 5
- Scale: +25
- Limit: 3

##### 2. Shape Control
#### -=[ Homing ]=-
-=[ Homing ]=-
With precise chakra control, you can learn to curve and aim your ninjutsu in such a way to ensure they hit more effectively. You may give your ninjutsu a bonus of +1 Accuracy per rank, by increasing the Chakra and/or Stamina cost(s) of the ninjutsu by 2 per +1 added. Ninjutsu with a range of Touch, and those which have an Area (e.g., are Area of Effect), can not have this ability applied to them.

- Base Cost: 8
- Scale: 4
- Limit: Chakra Control ranks/5, max 6

#### -=[ Improved Area ]=-
This supplements your ninjutsu techniques, increasing their areas of effect by up to your ninjutsu damage bonus; you can use some, all, or none of this effect on a given technique, as you please. This bonus cannot exceed the technique's base area. This bonus only applies to ninjutsu that deal damage.

- Base Cost: 20

#### -=[ Improved Range ]=-
You're able to keep your chakra coherent for longer; the further it can travel before dissipating (or the faster you can propel it, or whatever)... well, the advantages should be obvious. This increases the range of any ninjutsu technique you use by up to double your ninjutsu damage bonus in yards. This bonus cannot exceed the technique's base range.

- Base Cost: 20

#### -=[ Potent Chakra ]=-
You're able to increase your chakra's density, and in turn preserve some of the energy that would dissipate into the atmosphere around you in whatever sort of attack you're using.
But all you really care about is that it makes your ninjutsu hurt more! Each rank increases your ninjutsu damage bonus by 0.2.

- Base Cost: 1
- Scale: 1
- Limit: CHA /10
- Requires: 80 CHA

##### 3. Chakra Control
#### -=[ Refined Chakra Control ]=-
Your precise control of chakra allows you to spend it more efficiently, wasting less and getting more out of what you do spend. Each rank of this ability gives you a +1 bonus on your Chakra Exhaustion rolls.

- Base Cost: 6
- Scale: 2
- Limit: Chakra Control /5

#### -=[ Wall Walking ]=-
Every village teaches this, usually to their genin, as a form of training to hone their chakra control skills. Training involves focusing a fixed amount of chakra at the bottom of one's feet and using that to adhere to a wall, tree, or other vertical surface. With this ability you can scale vertical surfaces, stand on ceilings, and so forth, at your normal movement speed.

- Base Cost: 10
- Requires: 8 Chakra Control

#### -=[ Water Walking ]=-
You can stand on water! Ninja do this in the same way they'd adhere to a vertical surface, though actually pulling it off is much harder because the water is constantly moving underneath them, meaning the strength and distribution of chakra has to be constantly changed. Once a shinobi is skilled enough, though, this becomes second nature, just like keeping one's balance on an unsteady surface.

- Base Cost: 15
- Requires: 15 Chakra Control, Wall Walking

##### 4. Genjutsu
#### -=[ Genjutsu Awareness ]=-
You're good at picking up little details in your environment that aren't quite what they should be. Maybe it's that the ringing noise in your head isn't reverberating right, maybe it's that whoever constructed an illusion around you forgot to put door handles on all the doors. You get a +1 bonus to defensive Genjutsu rolls per rank.

- Base Cost: 10
- Scale: 5
- Limit: Lower of your Enhanced Hearing or Enhanced Sight ranks

#### -=[ Genjutsu Competence ]=-
Genjutsu is notoriously difficult; very few ninja are able to just 'pick it up' without difficulty. Even being mediocre with genjutsu requires a significant amount of training and practice--which this ability represents. Each rank gives you a +1 bonus to your offensive Genjutsu rolls.

- Base Cost: 2
- Scale: 0
- Limit: (XP + 200)/400

#### -=[ Genjutsu Mastery ]=-
Okay, NOW you've mastered the art of Genjutsu. Each rank gives you a +1 bonus to genjutsu rolls. You can have 1 rank in this ability for each rank of genjutsu you know at least one technique from. Thus, if you knew an E-rank, D-rank, and B-rank move, you could have 3 ranks of Genjutsu Mastery.

- Base Cost: 6
- Scale: 4
- Limit: Special

#### -=[ Genjutsu Training ]=-
You've mastered the art of... yeah, okay, no. You are able to use entry-level Genjutsu techniques. It's not much, but it's a start.

- Base Cost: 20
- Requires: Research 4

#### -=[ Illusion Multi-Targeting ]=-
This allows you to apply a genjutsu which normally must target a single person at once to any number of people. Every 1 point of Willpower spent allows your genjutsu to target two more people, at no additional cost and using your same genjutsu roll.

- Base Cost: 25
- Requires: Know at least one C-rank Genjutsu

#### -=[ Mettle ]=-
Shinobi training includes not only dodging and withstanding blows to the body, but to the mind as well. With this, you're more adept at discerning the usage and resisting the effects of most subtle of shinobi methods, which is handy to keep yourself from becoming caught unaware by the other, more deadly tactics ninja employ, as well as enabling you to use those same subtleties against others. Each rank gives a +1 bonus to your Genjutsu rolls.

- Base Cost: 8
- Scale: 3
- Limit: Resistance /5

## Equipment

##### 1. Ninja Tools
#### -=[ Money: Requisition ]=-
As a ninja, you get most of your supplies from your village. This ability represents how much you're authorized to bring with you on any mission. This works more like a limit than something you actually 'spend'; you can replaced used items, trade in ones you no longer have a need for, and so forth, at will so long as you're not away. For every rank, you can have 50 Ryo worth of equipment from the Equipment chapter at once from the village.

- Base Cost: 2
- Scale: 0
- Limit: None

#### -=[ Money: Savings ]=-
This is a nest egg of money you've set aside and saved up over time. For each rank, you have 100 Ryo that you can spend as you please. This money cannot be refunded or replenished; used or broken items are simply lost.

- Base Cost: 2
- Scale: 0
- Limit: None

#### -=[ Bingo Book ]=-
The bingo book is a pocket-sized book put out by each village, with information on missing nin and enemy ninja of note. This information includes their bounties, their reputation, and any abilities which the village may be willing to publicize. Having this ability means you keep an up-to-date copy of the bingo book; you can steal someone else's, but they generally get updated every few months.

- Base Cost: 5

#### -=[ Icha Icha Novels ]=-
Icha Icha is a series of best-selling novels written by the legendary ninja sage Jiraiya. They are comedic (and adult) recounts of Jiraiya's experiences in love. The titles include Icha Icha Paradise, Icha Icha Violence, Icha Icha Tactics, and Icha Icha Utopia. They are intended only for audiences over 18 years of age, and managing to acquire and read them in secret is a challenge countless young ninja strive to overcome. Indeed, it's how many shinobi (though most kunoichi would never admit it) hone their abilities of stealth and deception. For every rank, you have read one of the Icha Icha novels. Every novel you've read gives you a +1 bonus to your Espionage rolls.

- Base Cost: 6
- Scale: 4
- Limit: 4

#### -=[ Aerosolized Poisons ]=-
As popular as poisons are with (some) shinobi, they suffer from being relatively difficult to deliver effectively. While gaseous poisons are one of the most effective ways of accomplishing that, very few of the toxins suitable for use against shinobi can be deployed that way. Unless, of course, someone is willing to invest a great deal of time and resources into specially preparing those poisons, and learning enough about them to understand the dangers of those preparations. Like you! This ability allows you to create a Poison Smoke Bomb from any Contact poison (as found in the Equipment chapter) and converts that poisons type to Inhalation. The total cost for the poison smoke bomb is doubled (for example, Water Hemlock Poison Smoke Bombs would be 1200 ryo each), and the Toxicology roll has a -4 penalty.

- Base Cost: 50
- Requires: 25 Toxicology

#### -=[ Tag Concealment ]=-
Ninjas do love their explosions. However, they also like being sneaky and unseen; this combines the two! When placing an exploding tag, you can hide it from the casual observer. This requires something for it to be hidden under (such as loose soil, or leaves; you cannot 'hide' them in plain sight in a featureless room). Hiding a tag is a Speed 10 action, and anyone watching you will realize what you're doing and where it is (meaning it cannot be accomplished outside of stealth in combat). When you hide the tag, make an Espionage roll. Anyone who enters the tag's range is allowed an Awareness roll against the result, without any bonuses they may have from the Enhanced Hearing ability. Success means they've spotted the tag. Once a tag has begun its countdown to detonation they start to sizzle and spark, alerting anyone to their presence and approximate direction (though not exact location), giving them a chance to escape before time runs out.

- Base Cost: 10

##### 2. Weapons, Melee
#### -=[ Ambidextrous ]=-
You've trained yourself to use your off-hand just as well as your dominant one, or you really are naturally ambidextrous. Each rank reduces the Accuracy penalty for the Dual Wield Attack action (see below) and derivatives of it such as Centipede Strike by 1, and each even rank (2 and 4) gives you a +1 bonus to parries using those weapons while dual-wielding, though it follows the normal rules for using two weapons (using the lower of the two weapon's Accuracy).

- Base Cost: 5
- Scale: 2
- Limit: DEX /20, max 5

#### -=[ Dual Wielding ]=-
You attack with a weapon in each hand! Impractical, but awesome. As might be expected, this allows you to make a basic weapon attack with both weapons simultaneously. Halve the speed of both the weapons you're using (rounding up, as usual). Add those two numbers together to get the speed of your "Dual Wield Attack" action. You use the lower of the two weapons' Accuracy. This is defended against as a single attack, using its total Speed. The Stamina cost to Dual-Wield is the higher Stamina cost of the two weapons, plus one third of the lower Stamina cost. If you hit, you deal damage separately for both weapons, using the reduced Speed for each to determine their damage bonus. Weapons specifically marked as "Dual" calculate damage based on their natural Speed, rather than the halved value. Lowering the Speed of a Dual Wield Attack action lowers the effective Speeds (for determining damage) of both component attacks by the same amount. This can't be done with two-handed weapons. Unfortuantely, the Dual Wield Attack action (and derivatives of it such as Centipede Strike) carries with it a -5 Accuracy penalty.

- Base Cost: 25
- Requires: 40 DEX

#### -=[ Monkey Grip ]=-
By using extreme strength, chakra-based powers, and a cheerful disregard for physics, you are able to use twohanded weapons in one hand! Notably, this means they no longer benefit from their 50% increase in your damage bonus. At the second rank you can, if you have the Dual Wield ability, even dual wield two-handed weapons.

- Base Cost: 30
- Scale: 10
- Limit: STR /50, max 2

#### -=[ Quick Draw ]=-
The speed of your Draw Weapon is reduced by 1 per rank, to a minimum of 0.

- Base Cost: 7
- Scale: 1
- Limit: DEX / 30

#### -=[ Weapon Focus: (Weapon) ]=-
You've trained yourself specifically with a single type of weapon. Choose one of the weapons from the Equipment chapter (such as Wakizashi, or Shuriken). You have +1 Accuracy and +1 to your damage bonus when using that weapon to make an attack, per rank. Weapon focus cannot be applied to defensive rolls, nor to any other use that have no assocaited stamina cost. You may take this ability for different weapons, counting as a different ability (with a separate cost, number of ranks, etc.) each time. Any attack which benefits from your Weapon Focus has its Stamina cost increased by 3 per rank; you may choose to use less than your full ranks of Weapon Focus on a given attack if you wish.

- Base Cost: 6
- Scale: 2
- Limit: (DEX-30) /30, max 3

#### -=[ Weapon Throw ]=-
Your hatred of physics gives you improbable powers. You are able to throw any melee weapon you're holding up to STR/4 yards, turning it into a ranged attack. This does the normal damage for that weapon, but increases the action's Stamina cost by 5.

- Base Cost: 15
- Requires: 40 STR, 40 DEX

#### -=[ Blunt: Stun ]=-
Your attacks stagger an opponent, club them upside the head, knock the wind out of them, or otherwise keeping them from recovering. Your blunt weapon attacks gain Stun 1 per rank, or increase their existing Stun by 1 per rank.

- Base Cost: 5
- Scale: 2
- Limit: STR /20, max 5

#### -=[ Large: Momentum ]=-
You turn one of the greatest enemies of shinobi--physics--to your own ends. Each rank gives a -1 penalty to any enemy's attempts to parry your weapon.

- Base Cost: 4
- Scale: 2
- Limit: STR /30, max 3

#### -=[ Piercing: Penetrate ]=-
Your piercing weapons ignore half of the Damage Reduction (DR) any enemy might have.

- Base Cost: 20
- Requires: 40 STR

#### -=[ Polearm: Trip ]=-
You sweep with the blunt end (or one of the blunt ends) of your weapon, knocking your opponent's feet out from beneath them. This allows you to use Trip (the E-rank Unarmed Taijutsu technique) as a Weapon Taijutsu, as long as you know it.

- Base Cost: 10

#### -=[ Slashing: Perfect Cut ]=-
Normally, when partial defense applies you would deal 20% of your attack's damage per point you hit by. With this ability you do 25% per point you hit by, up to full damage if you hit by 4 points.

- Base Cost: 20
- Requires: 40 DEX

#### -=[ Small: Flurry ]=-
Most of the small weapons rely on something other than overpowering force to deal their damage; accordingly, a dozen quick strikes is often preferable to six slow, powerful ones. Each time you make an attack with a Small weapon, the total Speed of your next attack with that weapon is reduced by 1. This stacks for consecutive attacks; if you make three attacks with your weapon, without taking any non-Interrupt action inbetween, the next attack would have -3 total Speed. As a reminder, total Speed cannot go below half of base Speed. The maximum reduction is your number of ranks in this ability.

- Base Cost: 4
- Scale: 2
- Limit: DEX /25, max 4

#### -=[ Sword: Iaijutsu ]=-
The first time in battle you attack with your sword, if you have yet to draw it (meaning it hasn't be used for parries or jutsu, either) the attack's Speed is halved, though for the purpose of damage calculations it's treated as its regular speed. This may only be done once per battle, even if you have more than one sword

- Base Cost: 20
- Requires: 50 DEX, 40 AGI

##### 3. Weapons, Ranged
#### -=[ Assassin's Eye ]=-
You've got a good eye for causing bodily harm to people from a distance. In any other job, this would just make you kind of scary. As a ninja, it looks good on your resume! Each rank of this ability reduces the penalty for called shots with ranged weapons by 1.

- Base Cost: 6
- Scale: 4
- Limit: DEX /30, max 3
- Requires: Enhanced Sight 3

#### -=[ Combat Acupuncture ]=-
You can throw senbon to target vital points on an opponent's body. Whenever making a called shot with senbon, if you deal damage you inflict a -2 immobilization penalty on your foe. Using this on somebody already suffering from it increases the Immobilization penalty by 1 each time. The maximum penalty is your rank in this ability.

- Base Cost: 2
- Scale: 2
- Limit: DEX /10
- Requires: Medicine 10

#### -=[ Explosive Tag Connection ]=-
As a Speed 10 + 5 * X action, you can attach X tags to a kunai's hilt or an arrow, and prime them. These can be attached pre-battle as a matter of convenience, but the action to prime them is still necessary. You can have up to (Chakra Control)/5 tags primed this way at once. Each item (kunai or arrow) may only have a single tag attached to it. You can trigger these tags as part of a multithrow, or do so later (such as by the Remote Detonation technique). When the kunai is thrown (or arrow shot) the tag(s) will detonate 15 IC after impact (with the target, or the ground at the target's feet on a miss). When used as a multi-throw, each tagged kunai counts as two weapons for the purpose of determining multi-throwing limit. You can include up to one tag per rank in this ability in a single throw. If a target is struck by the arrow or kunai, they're assumed to pull it out as a non-action and can try to escape the area. Jutsu including exploding tags that cause them to explode on contact supercede these rules.

- Base Cost: 5
- Scale: 3
- Limit: Chakra Control /5

#### -=[ Improved Range ]=-
You can throw weapons farther than other people! It's useful, honest!... Kind of. Sometimes. Your max range with thrown weapons is increased by your physical damage bonus.

- Base Cost: 15

#### -=[ Quick Hands ]=-
You're very good at throwing lots of small objects very quickly! This allows you to throw an extra weapon when multi-throwing, without increasing the action's Speed; the Stamina cost is still increased normally (+1 for every 2 weapons total, adding together ones added normally and ones added by Quick Hands).

- Base Cost: 5
- Scale: 1
- Limit: DEX /25

#### -=[ Senbon Multi-Throw ]=-
You can multi-throw needles, just like you can normally multi throw shuriken and kunai.

- Base Cost: 15
- Requires: 30 DEX

#### -=[ Senbon User ]=-
You're a person who uses senbon in combat. This is rare, but not unheard of; it takes a lot of effort to get results out of them, but a weapon that allows the degree of precision they do can certainly be rewarding. This ability changes the senbon's inherent -2 Accuracy into a +1 Accuracy bonus, and allows you to use your DEX, rather than STR, to determine your damage bonus with senbon. Finally, damage dealt by senbon is doubled for the purposes of calculating wounds.

- Base Cost: 15
- Requires: 25 DEX

#### -=[ Surgical Precision ]=-
When you wound an enemy with a senbon attack, you have a 10% chance per rank for the wound to be upgraded to the next-highest rank. If you don't wound them, this is replaced by a 10% chance per rank to cause a minor wound, so long as your attack did any damage. Every rank of this ability also raises the attack's Stamina cost by 1; you can choose whether or not to use it, and to what extent, when you attack. If used on a multi-throwing attack with senbon, this is applied before the one-rank reduction in wound severity (from being a multi-throw).

- Base Cost: 2
- Scale: 2
- Limit: Medicine /2, max 10

## Physical

##### 1. Vigor
#### -=[ Breathing Exercises ]=-
Quick recovery and bursts of speed are integral to the way Shinobi fight, as most opponents feign ignorance whenever you try to remind them of the genin training-ground rule of 'time out'. In such cases, it's important to know how to circulate air efficiency as opposed to just panting like a ninken. Each rank reduces the base Speed of the Rest action by 1.

- Base Cost: 8
- Scale: 4
- Limit: RES /40, Max 5

#### -=[ Brute Force ]=-
You're good at... well, exactly what it sounds like: applying a lot of force all at once. It might be sheer physical strength, or you could just know how to strike properly. Each rank increases your physical damage bonus by 0.2.

- Base Cost: 1
- Scale: 1
- Limit: STR /10
- Requires: 80 STR

#### -=[ Cadence ]=-
Once you get into a good rhythm, you find it easier and easier to maintain and keep building your momentum. All your Combo jutsu have "-1 Stamina" added to their Combo Counter line. This cannot reduce a technique's cost below half its normal value.

- Base Cost: 30
- Requires: +6 or higher bonus to Stamina rolls, without Fatigue bonuses

#### -=[ Endurance ]=-
Your extensive physical conditioning has given you an almost preternatural ability to shrug off damage. When you block, you may choose to reduce the damage dealt by an additional 10% at the first rank, or an additional 25% at the second rank. This may only be done once every 30-(RES/10) IC.

- Base Cost: 25
- Scale: 10
- Limit: 2
- Requires: 60 RES

#### -=[ Fortitude ]=-
Every rank of this ability gives you a +2 bonus to Resistance rolls when you block an attack (even if you are doing so reflexively); if you've declared that you're blocking, this also applies to any effects requiring a Resistance roll which you wouldn't normally get to defend against (such as the B-rank Poison Mist). If you've declared you're blocking for a certain time period, and take another defense (for example: you are blocking from IC 20 to IC 30, and on IC 24 you dodge an attack, and are hit) half of this abilities bonus will still apply to your rolls.

- Base Cost: 2
- Scale: 2
- Limit: STR /20, max 5

#### -=[ Good Lungs ]=-
All this ninja work has left you well beyond what peak physical condition would be for an ordinary person. In addition to being able to fight and exert yourself for abnormally long times, you recover from such exertion almost supernaturally fast. When you use the Rest action to lower your Stamina penalty, it's reduced by 1 more per rank (so at two ranks, a Rest action would decrease your Stamina penalty by 3).

- Base Cost: 10
- Scale: 5
- Limit: RES /80

#### -=[ Hard to Kill ]=-
You prove distressingly difficult to make dead. Your max Vitality and HP are increased by 10% per rank. However, Wounds are calculated off your unmodified ("true") maximums. For example, if you had 1000 Vitality and 3 ranks of Hard to Kill, you'd have 1300 Vitality. However, your "true" maximum would still be 1000, and wounds would be determined based off what percent of 1000 Vitality their damage was.

- Base Cost: 6
- Scale: 1
- Limit: RES /20
- Requires: 80 RES

#### -=[ Healthy ]=-
You get plenty of exercise, and probably eat healthily. When your job places serious physical demands upon you (such as leaping across chasms and running over rooftops), this can be useful. You have a +1 bonus to Stamina rolls per rank.

- Base Cost: 6
- Scale: 2
- Limit: Athletics /5

#### -=[ Power Attack ]=-
You put extra force behind your unarmed strikes, turning your feeble punches into fearsome punches! Or... something like that. Each rank allows you to increase the Stamina cost, and die size, of your basic unarmed attack by 2. So at rank 1, you could deal 2d6 damage for 7 Stamina; and at rank 4, you could deal 2d12 damage for 13 Stamina.

- Base Cost: 4
- Scale: 4
- Limit: STR /20, max 4

#### -=[ Resilient ]=-
You're harder to hurt than you have any right to be! Each rank reduces damage you take from Grapple Taijutsu by 5%.

- Base Cost: 4
- Scale: 1
- Limit: RES /20, max 10

#### -=[ Rigorous Training ]=-
You've spent time training in, or just being exposed to, extreme conditions; sitting under waterfalls, trudging through sand dunes, or enduring intense cold without the proper clothing are all examples of how this might come about. You have a +1 bonus to Resistance rolls per rank.

- Base Cost: 2
- Scale: 2
- Limit: RES /20

#### -=[ Shadowboxing ]=-
When your opponent disappears, you keep your momentum going by doing katas and keeping ready to strike while assessing your surroundings. You can perform the Search action without breaking your Combo, but if you do not find the target of your Combo as a result of the action, your Combo Counter is reduced by 1.

- Base Cost: 20
- Requires: Athletics 10, Awareness 10

#### -=[ Unarmed Focus ]=-
You've trained to improve your sheer physical prowess; even when resorting to simple, non-jutsu attacks, you hit hard. May or may not be the result of deciding to train by punching trees until your knuckles bleed. Each rank lets you roll one more die when making a basic unarmed attack.

- Base Cost: 3
- Scale: 0
- Limit: (STR - 20) /10

______________________
##### 2. Mobility
#### -=[ Evasive ]=-
You're big on not being around when people try to violently end your life. Every rank gives you a +1 bonus to dodge, it's awesome!

- Base Cost: 4
- Scale: 2
- Limit: AGI /20, max 10

#### -=[ Nimble ]=-
When targeted by an area-of-effect attack that gives you a dodge penalty based on its size, that penalty is reduced by 2 per rank, to a minimum of 0.

- Base Cost: 4
- Scale: 1
- Limit: AGI /20

#### -=[ Runner ]=-
You're both a distance runner and sprinter! Pretty awesome, huh? Every rank in this ability increases your AGI for the purpose of movement by 5% when you're taking a Move action; moving as part of an attack, or techniques such as Shunshin, do not receive Runner's bonus.

- Base Cost: 3
- Scale: 2
- Limit: Athletics /4, max 5

#### -=[ Sudden Attack ]=-
You sacrifice power for speed and precision, trying to overwhelm or overcome your opponent's defenses before they have a chance to protect themselves. For every rank, you may take a bonus of up to +1 on a damaging taijutsu attack's Accuracy; each +1 reduces its damage by 10%.

- Base Cost: 4
- Scale: 1
- Limit: DEX /20, max 5

#### -=[ Swift ]=-
Swift, adjective; happening quickly or promptly. Your swiftness allows you to react faster, and makes it harder for your opponents to keep up with you. Each rank gives you +1 to Accuracy.

- Base Cost: 8
- Scale: 2
- Limit: (AGI - 50) /10, max 5
