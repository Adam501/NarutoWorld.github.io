Located in the middle of Fire Country. Konoha experiences the full gamut of desirable weather - that is to say, it's usually sunny, and even the rainy days can be pleasant. The village is roughly one third smaller than it was before the war, but strolling down the streets of Konoha you might never realize unless someone told you.

Konoha does not appear to have been damaged by the war at all. The unwavering Will of Fire blazed in the hearts of the survivors and they set about rebuilding and landscaping the damaged parts of the village almost immediately. Narrow brick pathways sprawl from the outer edges of the village, shaded by decades old oak trees, leading to small housing communities tucked neatly into the forest. The village is more a part of the forest now than it had ever been in the past. Many buildings in downtown Konoha received new facades or were rebuilt completely. Beyond this, the village isn't looking to waste resources on overextending its boundaries. They make room for new citizens as it's required. In the meantime, all the spaces reserved for future expansion are filled with neatly kept parks and forested areas.

The forces of Konoha have the clans of Aburame, Akimichi, Inuzuka, Hyuuga, Nara, Senju, Uchiha, and the Yamanaka to call upon.

After the Fourth Great Shinobi war, Konoha was no longer the most densely populated village. They had the largest population of civilians and shinobi before the war - and in honor of all those lost they built a second monument in the east. As tradition in Konoha goes, they'll never forget those who gave their lives for their village, but they won't let the past keep them from building the brightest future they can. Even a century after the war, the Will of Fire burns more brightly now than it had ever in the past.

Unfortunately all of this good will does not pay the bills. Because Konoha had the most to lose, it lost the most. They're steadily rebuilding, and each generation of shinobi seems more bright and promising than the last.

## Aburame
The Aburame are one of the four noble clans of Konohagakure, and are among the most reclusive and aloof. They are distinguishable by their distinctive fashion; most choose to cover majority of their body with long, loose clothing and dark glasses that hide their eyes; duster coats and round glasses are popular choices. Aburame tend to be soft-spoken and matter of fact, and rarely deal in 'small talk' or social pleasantries.

Their solitude is rightly contributed to their kekkai genkai; from a young age, every clan member is made host to a hive of insects called Kikaichuu, a special type of beetle that feasts on chakra. The Aburame's body becomes a nest for these bugs, who flourish and grow alongside their host. Eventually, this symbiotic relationship allows the Aburame to mentally control and direct their personal swarm; it is this deep unity that makes their kekkai genkai so powerful, and so unsettling.

**Beginning as an Aburame costs 1 Unique Point.**

##### The Kikaichū Swarm

The keystone of all Aburame techniques, the Kikaichuu swarm provides a versatile mix of offense, defense, and utility, limited only by the size of the Aburame's swarm. Although most Aburame have a swarm within them, it takes dedication and effort to raise that swarm into a fighting entity.
Aburame have access to the following ability:

**Kikaichū Hive**

Base Cost: 5

Scale: 0

Limit: 4 + (Total XP/400)

Effects: Your first rank in this ability grants you a Swarm with a maximum Swarm Size of 1, and one queen Kikai. Your maximum Swarm Size increases by 1 for every rank thereafter, and you gain one additional queen Kikai every 3 ranks thereafter (1, 4, 7, etc). This swarm is inside your body, and must be deployed to be used.

A damaged swarm recovers at a rate of 1 Swarm Size every 3 OOC hours. If all of your queen Kikai die, you instead recover 1 Swarm Size every 6 OOC hours; upon recovering your maximum Swarm Size, you regain 1 queen Kikai every 3 OOC hours.

You have access to the following actions:

**Deploy (Speed X)**

You release a swarm of Size X from your body, where X is no greater than your maximum Swarm Size. You may also deploy up to X/2 queen Kikai, to your max number owned. Your swarm forms a cloud in an X yard radius around you.

While deployed, any time you are hit by an area attack, you lose 1 Swarm Size worth of insects; if the attack wounds you, you lose 1 additional Swarm Size for each level of wound's severity (1 for Minor, 2 for Major, etc.) For every two Swarm Sizes lost, you also lose 1 queen Kikai, if any are deployed.

If you are afflicted with an Ignite effect, you lose 1 Swarm Size every 5 IC until the Ignite is removed.

If you have deployed a swarm of size 10 or greater, any loss of Swarm Size is doubled until the Swarm Size is reduced below 10. Loss of queen Kikai is not doubled.

**Recall (Speed X/2 or +X/2, Interrupt)**

You may recall X Swarm Sizes worth of insects into your body, where X is no greater than your currently deployed Swarm Size. These insects cannot be used for actions or jutsu until you take a Deploy action to redeploy them.

You may also recall your swarm as part of a dodge defense. Used in this way, you add the speed of your dodge to the speed of the Recall action; if the new speed would invalidate your dodge, you cannot use this action. On a successful dodge, your swarm avoids all damage and is recalled; on a failed dodge, your swarm takes damage as usual, but is returned thereafter.

**Defense Formation (Speed 0)**

You may prepare your swarm to intercept an attack. When you take this action, you may dedicate any number of your deployed Swarm Size to prepare to defend you. Swarm Sizes dedicated to defense cannot be used to attack, or perform any other clan jutsu; they may only be used for the Bug Repellant action. For the purposes of the Bug Repellant action, X is equal to your dedicated defense Swarm.

**Bug Repellant (Speed 5 + X, Interrupt**

You may deflect an attack using your dedicated defense Swarm. Roll a ninjutsu parry with a bonus of +(X/2). If you succeed, reduce the damage of the attack by up to (CHA * X); if this reduces the damage to 0, nullify all other effects of the attack (wounds, conditions, etc). For every (CHA) damage reduced in this way, you lose 1 Swarm Size, to a minimum loss of 1. Whether this action succeeds or fails, you may choose to remove any number of Swarm Sizes from your defense swarm; they can then be used to attack, or to perform any other clan jutsu, but can no longer be used for the Bug Repellant action.

**Internal Defenses (Special)**
While a deployed swarm can be an overwhelming fighting force, an internal swarm still offers several powerful benefits. You gain a +1 bonus to Genjutsu defense for every 3 Swarm Sizes left undeployed within you. Additionally, you reduce the duration of all poisons- and their conditions- by 1/2 for every 8 Swarm Sizes left undeployed within you. (To 1/4th duration at 16 Swarm Size, 1/8th at 24 Swarm Size, etc.)

**Elemental Swarm**

As the Aburame lineage has evolved, so too have their insects. It is increasingly common to see Kikaichuu swarms that emulate more intimate aspects of their host's chakra; most commonly, their elemental nature.

Base Cost: 20

Scale: 0

Limit: 1 + (EXP/1000)

Effects: At first rank, you gain the ability to deploy insects of your Elemental Affinity. Each rank thereafter, you may choose an element for which you have the Elemental Aptitude ability (excluding your Affinity), and may deploy insects of that element.

Insects of an elemental type gain several benefits and drawbacks, listed below:

* Elemental Swarms used to take the Bug Repellant action suffer no swarm size reduction when used to parry an attack of the element they are strong against, but cannot be used to parry attacks of the element they are weak to.

* A Secret Technique: Insect Bite that includes an Elemental Swarm becomes a ninjutsu of that swarm's element for all purposes.

A Swarm's elemental type (or lack thereof) is determined when they are deployed (as part of the Deploy action); once deployed, you must Recall and Redeploy a swarm to alter or remove its elemental type.

##### Hijutsu: Mushiyose - Secret Technique: Insect Gathering

By touching the ground and sending their chakra out in a web-like pattern, an Aburame can call the attention of nearby insects. Since the Aburame can communicate with them, it's a handy way to gain basic information about an area. Some Aburame have had very successful entertainment careers by way of this technique, using a mix of colorful and exotic bugs.

Type: Ninjutsu, Rank E

Chakra: X

Speed: X

Seal Speed: 10

Area: X * 5

Effects: Any insects within (X * 5) yards are drawn to you, allowing you to gather information from them. Most insects are only concerned with very primitive things (eating, survival, and reproduction), and therefore are limited in what they may know, but will communicate what they can.
Keep in mind this is not a capacity to talk to insects, merely communicate with them; they do not understand human speech. If used as distance messengers, the insects are only capable of carrying tiny, single word notes across short distances (a mile at most); however, you can gather and move them around to form highly visible and unique signals.

##### Hijutsu: Mushisasare - Secret Technique: Insect Bite

A relatively straightforward technique, in which an Aburame directs their swarm to attack an enemy.

Type: Ninjutsu, Rank D

Chakra: 5 + X * 2

Damage: Xd20

Range: 15 + X/2

Speed: 5 + X/2

Area: X

Effects: You may choose to exclude any number of targets from the area of this attack.

Any target that this technique successfully damages increases their Chakra Exhaustion penalty by X/2, where X is the Swarm Size dedicated to this attack. Then, any target who's Chakra Exhaustion penalty exceeds their Chakra Exhaustion Bonus by ten or more immediately advances a Fatigue level. Your own Chakra Exhaustion penalty is then reduced by X/2, so long as one person was successfully hit by the attack.

An Aburame with the Elemental Swarm ability may increase the Chakra cost of their Insect Bite by 5 to gain an additional effect, depending on the element of the Swarm used:

Raiton Swarm: Insect Bite inflicts Paralysis X/4 on hit.

Suiton Swarm: Insect Bite inflicts an -X/3 Immobilization penalty on hit. This Immobilization penalty wears off after 10 IC. Additionally, a Suiton Swarm can be used underwater.

Fuuton Swarm: Blocking against Insect Bite is reduced by (X * 5)%.

Katon Swarm: Insect Bite inflicts Burn X/2 on hit.

Doton Swarm: Insect Bite inflicts Stun X/3 on hit.

##### Kumichou Kikaichū - Kingpin Destruction Insects

It's not a rare sight to see an Aburame use their Kikai queens in battle, but it is a risky one; the queens are central to the hive structure, and the loss of even one can throw the swarm into temporary disarray. But queens are quite powerful, and more enterprising Aburame learn to use them a more subtle way; as trackers or--more often--as spotters.

Type: Ninjutsu, Rank C

Chakra: +5

Speed: +4

Range: Variable

Effects: This jutsu is used alongside any Swarm attack or defense. It's range is equal to the attack's range, if attacking, or equal to your current Deployed swarm size, if defending. If the action is successful, you also implant a queen Kikai on the target.

Your target makes an Awareness Roll versus your Stealth roll when the Kikai is first attached, but thereafter the Kikai is considered to be in Stealth 3, and the target typically has no reason to suspect its presence. If found, the target can crush the Kikai as a Speed 2 action.

For as long as the Kikai is attached, your Insect Bite gains an Accuracy bonus of +X/4 against the target, where X is equal to your deployed Swarm Size. You also have a +5 bonus to Awareness against the target, and consider them to be 1 Stealth level lower, if they are hidden. If this would reduce them to Stealth 0, you and your clones can attack them as normal with ranged attacks.

You can implant as many queen Kikai as you have available, but can only attach a single Kikai to any given target (attaching more gives no added benefit). Implanting queen Kikai does not reduce your maximum Swarm Size, but does limit how many Swarm Size you can recover via Insect Cocoon (detailed below).

##### Mushi Bunshin - Insect Clone

A jutsu that inspires both awe and fear, the Insect Clone Technique allows a skilled Aburame to gather thousands of Kikai into a startling replica of themselves. It isn't particularly rugged, but the Kikai's attunement with their host's chakra allows them to emulate the Aburame's jutsu to deadly effect.

Type: Ninjutsu, Rank C

Chakra: 10

Speed: 10

Seal Speed: 10

Swarm Size: X

Special: 1 Willpower, 1 Female Kikai

Effects: You create a clone of yourself, dedicating X Swarm Size to the clone. It counts as having your Vitality and defenses (for wounding purposes), but is reduced in size like a standard Swarm, with the obvious exception that it applies when the clone is hit, as opposed to the Aburame.

Your deployed and maximum Swarm Size is reduced by X until the clone is dispersed; a clone dispersed by damage refunds your maximum Swarm Size, but you must recover your lost swarm as usual. However, you can voluntarily dismiss the clone at any time by using the Recall action; this returns the swarm to your body as usual, and refunds your maximum Swarm Size. Any queen Kikai are also returned; however, you do not recover any spent Willpower.

You may use the Hide Amongst Clones action--and can likewise be Observed--as normal. However, if your insect clones take any damage or fail to evade a grapple, it becomes obvious that they're a clone. Even the Aburame can't turn into a cloud of bugs when struck or grabbed.

The clone can perform any jutsu you know, but has no chakra of its own; you make all Chakra Exhaustion and Stamina rolls in place of your clone, and if it would advance a fatigue level, you advance a fatigue level instead. Your clone acts only when you spend AP for it to do so, and although it has no place in the initiative count, it cannot be told to act again until the full IC of its previous action has passed.

You have access to the following commands:

**Dodge (1 AP) or Parry (2 AP)**- Your clone takes the Dodge or Parry action; treat your AP spent as the speed of this action for all purposes.

**Basic Taijutsu (X AP)** - Your clone makes a basic unarmed or basic weapon attack. This costs 1 AP per 2 speed of the attack.</p>

**Advanced Jutsu (X AP)** - Your clone performs any jutsu that you know. This costs 1 AP per 2 speed of the attack. If the jutsu includes a Seal Speed, it is added to the AP cost of this action.

An Insect Clone's attacks are always considered to be Held Back, as detailed in the Abilities chapter; as such, a clone uses only half of your relevant damage bonus, and the severity of any wounds they inflict is reduced by one category.

##### Hijutsu: Mushimayu - Secret Technique: Insect Cocoon

Type: Ninjutsu, Rank C

Chakra: 5 * X (minimum 15)

Upkeep: Special

Speed: 5 * X

Your Swarm Size is increased by X, where X is no greater than the number of queen Kikai you control. Swarm Size generated in this manner is initially considered Internal (and therefore not deployed), and must be Deployed as usual.

You may use this technique to grow your swarm past your normal limit, up to (Your Maximum Swarm Size * 1.5). However, your hive is not meant to support this many insects for long; any Swarm Size beyond your natural limit die or disperse at the end of the battle.

This technique has an Upkeep of Y, where Y is equal to the Swarm Size you have in excess of your normal limit. This cannot be used to restore lost female kikai.
